# course-matcher

This (abandoned) project's motivation is to allow students to choose a course at the University of Malta based on their entry subjects. The course data (App_Data/UOMCourses.xml) is incomplete. It was mined from the university's website (www.um.edu.mt), however not all courses followed the same template.

The project was abandoned since a similar service started being offerred by the university in 2017 (http://www.um.edu.mt/sas/findyourcourse/).
